# SOCC
SFU Opinion and Comments Corpus

The SFU Opinion and Comments Corpus (SOCC) is a corpus for the analysis of online news comments. Our corpus contains comments and the articles from which the comments originated. The articles are all opinion articles, not hard news articles. The corpus is larger than any other currently available comments corpora, and has been collected with attention to preserving reply structures and other metadata. In addition to the raw corpus, we also present annotations for four different phenomena: constructiveness, toxicity, negation and its scope, and appraisal.

# <a name="raw"></a>Raw data 
The corpus contains 10,339 opinion articles (editorials, columns, and op-eds) together with their 663,173 comments from 303,665 comment threads, from the main Canadian daily in English, <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, for a five-year period (from January 2012 to December 2016). We organize our corpus into three sub-corpora: the articles corpus, the comments corpus, and the comment-threads corpus, organized into three CSV files: gnm_articles.csv, gnm_comments.csv, and gnm_comment_threads.csv.

# <a name="annotated"></a>Annotated data

## <a name="constructiveness"></a>SFU constructiveness and toxicity corpus

We annotated a subset of SOCC for constructiveness and toxicity. The annotated corpus is organized as a CSV and contains 1,043 annotated comments in responses to 10 different articles covering a variety of subjects: technology, immigration, terrorism, politics, budget, social issues, religion, property, and refugees. For half of the articles, we included only top-level comments. For the other half, we included both top-level comments and responses. We used CrowdFlower (then Figure Eight, now Appen) as our crowdsourcing annotation platform and annotated the comments for constructiveness. We asked the annotators to first read the articles, and then to tell us whether the displayed comment was constructive or not. 

For toxicity, we asked annotators a multiple-choice question, *How toxic is the comment?* Four answers were possible:

  - Very toxic (4)
  - Toxic (3)
  - Mildly toxic (2)
  - Not toxic (1)

More information on the annotation, and the instructions to annotators, is available in the CrowdFlower_instructions file. 

## SFU_constructiveness_toxicity_corpus.csv
<b>article_id</b><br>
A unique identifier for the article. This identifier can be used to link the comment to the appropriate article from gnm_articles.csv in the raw corpus.

<b>comment_counter</b><br>
The comment counter which encodes the position and depth of a comment in a comment thread. The comment counter can be used to link the comment to the raw corpus. 

<b>title</b><br>
The title of The Globe and Mail opinion article. 

<b>globe_url</b><br>
The URL of the article on The Globe and Mail. 

<b>comment_text</b><br>
The comment text. 

<b>is_constructive</b><br>
Crowd's annotation on constructiveness (yes, no, not sure)

<b>is_constructive:confidence</b><br>
Crowd's confidence (between 0 to 1.0) about the answer. In CrowdFlower terminology, each annotator has a trust level based on how they perform on the gold examples, and each answer has a confidence, which is a normalized score of the summation of the trusts associated with annotators.

<b>toxicity_level</b><br>
Crowd's annotation on the toxicity level of the comment. Each comment was annotated by at least three annotators and so we are providing the first two popular answers and their associated confidence scores for toxicity level. If you want ground truth go with the first one, as it is the most popular answer.  

<b>toxicity_level:confidence</b><br>
Crowd's confidence (between 0 to 1.0) about the answer.

<b>did_you_read_the_article</b><br>
Whether the annotator has read the article or not. 

<b>did_you_read_the_article:confidence</b><br>
Crowd's confidence (between 0 to 1.0) about the answer.

<b>annotator_comments</b><br>
Free text comments from the annotators. 

<b>expert_is_constructive</b><br>
Expert's judgement on constructiveness of the comment. 

<b>expert_toxicity_level</b><br>
Expert's judgement on the toxicity level of the comment. 

<b>expert_comments</b><br>
Expert's free text comments on crowd's annotations. 

## <a name="negation"></a>SFU negation corpus
The negation annotations were performed using WebAnno. You can see [WebAnno server installation instructions](https://github.com/sfu-discourse-lab/WebAnno) on our GitHub page.

The guidelines directory contains a full description of the annotation guidelines. The annotations are made available as a project in .tsv files from WebAnno. The files were exported using the WebAnno v.3 format.

The WebAnno directory is structured in folders. There are five subfolders: annotation, annotation_ser, curation, curation_ser, and source. The folders annotation_ser and curation_ser contain documents in a format that WebAnno uses to import annotations and are difficult to read otherwise. The annotation folder includes the original annotations, while the curation folder contains the final annoatations. These two folders have subfolders themselves, one for each comment that was annotated. Each subfolder is named with a comment ID, and inside is a .tsv file with the annotations, named after the user who created those annotations. The annotations can be viewed from these .tsv files using a document viewer.

Each .tsv file begins with a comment line describing the format of the file (e.g. #FORMAT=WebAnno TSV 3.1) followed by one line for each column of data indicating which annotation layer is described by that column. Then, for each sentence in the annotated comment there is a line in the .tsv file with the whole sentence (e.g. #Text=This story gives broader context to the earlier reports of the abuse of band finances by the native leadership.). Each line after that one describes one word in the comment. The first column indicates which sentence the word is in followed by a dash, after which is the index of the word in the sentence (e.g., 1-1 for the first word in the first sentence). The second column indicates the position of the first and last character of the word in the comment (e.g. 0-4 for a four-letter word at the beginning of the comment). The third column gives the text of the word (e.g., This). The remaining columns indicate annotated labels.

In the Negation project, there is only one layer with four possible annotations: NEG, SCOPE, FOCUS, and XSCOPE. These labels appear in the fourth column of the .tsv file. If a span includes multiple words, it will be marked with an index; for example, a span of four words marked with the same SCOPE span might have SCOPE\[1] in column 4 for each word, while a single word annotated with NEG would have NEG in column 4 for that word. In comments with no negation annotations, there is no fourth column.

These projects can also be imported back into WebAnno, a process which we detail in the WebAnno instructions (see link above).

Note that file names in the constructiveness vs. negation and Appraisal projects are different. We also provide a mapping between the original comment IDs in the raw corpus and the constructiveness project, and the file names in the negation and Appraisal corpus.

## <a name="appraisal"></a>SFU Appraisal corpus

The Appraisal annotations were performed using WebAnno. The structure of the corpus is identical to that of the negation corpus, though the .tsv files are slightly different. Guidelines for Appraisal annotation are available in the guidelines directory.

The .tsv files for Appraisal have the category of Appraisal (i.e. Appreciation, Judgment, Affect) in the fourth column, its polarity (i.e. pos, neg, neu) in the fifth, the category of Graduation (i.e. Force, Focus) in the sixth, and the polarity of Graduation (e.g. up, down) in the seventh. For comments without Appraisal, there will only be three columns (the fourth and beyond will not appear). For comments without Graduation, there will be no sixth or seventh column. There are no comments with Graduation that lack Appraisal.

Spans that include multiple words are indexed in the same way that those in Negation are. For example, a multi-word span of Appreciation might have the annotation Appreciation\[1] in the fourth column for each word it covers, while a single-word span of Appreciation would simply have Appreciation in the fourth column in that word's row.
